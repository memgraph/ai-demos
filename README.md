# :sparkles: Memgraph AI Demos :sparkles:

There are various ways how AI can be utilized to interact with a graph database such as Memgraph.
Whether you're creating a knowledge graph from unstructured data, figuring out the best retrieval strategy, implementing GraphRAG or creating a fully autonomous agent - the possiblities are endless.

This repository is a collection of our demos and examples and we'll continue growing it as we learn. Here's what we have so far:

## [Knowledge graph creation](./knowledge-graph-creation/)

#TODO: write down/link to docs why this is important and list examples we have. 

## [Retrieval](./retrieval/)

#TODO: write down/link to docs why this is important and list examples we have. 

## [GraphRAG](./graph-rag/) 

[GraphRAG](https://memgraph.com/docs/ai-ecosystem/graph-rag) demo provides an implementation of RAG system

## [Agentic GraphRAG](./agentic-graph-rag/)

#TODO: write down/link to docs why this is important and list examples we have. 

## [Integrations](./integrations/)
