    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate\n",
    "[Cognee](https://github.com/cognee-ai/cognee) with\n",
    "[Memgraph](https://memgraph.com), a graph database platform, to automatically\n",
    "convert unstructured text into a semantically searchable knowledge graph using\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs). \n",
    "\n",
    "Cognee is an AI-powered toolkit for cognitive search and graph-based knowledge\n",
    "representation. It uses LLMs to break down natural language into structured\n",
    "concepts and relationships, storing them as graphs in Memgraph for further\n",
    "querying and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll take you through:\n",
    "- Setting up the environment with Docker and Poetry\n",
    "- Connecting Cognee to Memgraph\n",
    "- Adding unstructured text content\n",
    "- Generating a knowledge graph using LLMs\n",
    "- Performing semantic search over the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll be able to:\n",
    "- Create a local graph database instance with Memgraph\n",
    "- Automatically build and store knowledge graphs from plain text\n",
    "- Query your knowledge graph using natural language\n",

    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Docker**: Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed and running\n",
    "   in the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memgraph**: The easiest way to run Memgraph is using the following\n",
    "   commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux/macOS: `curl https://install.memgraph.com | sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows: `iwr https://windows.memgraph.com | iex`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will launch Memgraph at `localhost:3000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install neccessary dependencies, open your terminal and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry init\n",
    "poetry add cognee\n",
    "pip install neo4j\n",

    "In this notebook, we successfully demonstrated how to convert unstructured\n",
    "natural language text into a structured, queryable knowledge graph using Cognee\n",
    "and Memgraph. By leveraging the power of large language models, we extracted\n",
    "semantic relationships from raw text and stored them in a graph database for\n",
    "exploration and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration offers a powerful foundation for building intelligent systems\n",
    "that can understand, reason over, and retrieve knowledge in a human-like way.\n",
    "Whether you're working with internal documents, research papers, or customer\n",
